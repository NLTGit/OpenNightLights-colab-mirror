    "# DMSP-OLS intercalibration (5 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in {doc}`mod1_1_introduction_to_nighttime_light_data`, the DMSP-OLS sensors lacked on-board calibration, so there are noticeable variations from sensor to sensor. In order to adequately compare nighttime lights data across sensors, they must be calibrated. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we're going to calibrate DMSP-OLS data based on a method established by Elvidge et al. (2009) {cite}`elvidge2009fifteen`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "- Make sure you have Python, Jupyter notebooks, and geemap installed and are familiar with these packages\n",
    "- If not, you'll want to review: \n",
    "    - {doc}`mod1_3_getting_started_with_Python`\n",
    "    - {doc}`mod1_4_introduction_to_Jupyter_notebooks`\n",
    "    - {doc}`mod1_5_introduction_to_GEE` (you'll also need to have your GEE account created as shown in this tutorial)\n",
    "- You may also want to try this exercise to get familiar with GEE and the Python `geemap` library:\n",
    "    - {doc}`mod1_7_practical_exercise-image_visualization`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our tasks in this exercise:**\n",
    "1. Reviewing the calibration coefficients and formula used by Elvidge\n",
    "2. Apply calibration steps to a single image, 1996\n",
    "3. Compare the differences between calibrated and non-calibrated images.\n",
    "4. Create a function that dynamically applies the calibration depending on a given satellite/year input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reviewing the calibration coefficients and formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial paper {cite}`elvidge2009fifteen` cited outlines the steps the authors took, if you're interested in the details. What's important for our purposes here, is that they derived a set of coefficients that, when applied to each satellite in the DMSP series, provides a more stable calibrated measure of nighttime lights that corrects for the sensor variation and allows us to more accurately compare data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These coefficients map to a quadratic regresssion formula:\n",
    "$$X' = C_{0} + C_{1}*X + C_{2}*X^{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- X: the input image, represented as a 2-dimensional matrix (recall these images are panchromatic so there is only one channel of light)\n",
    "- $C_{0}, C_{1}, C_{2}$: the calibration coefficient (there's a set for each satellite)\n",
    "- X': the calibrated image\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial paper was written in 2009, prior to the final year of DMSP-OLS. We can get a more recent series of coefficients (through 2012) here (using the same method):\n",

    "**Note:** this method is fine for purposes of this tutorial, but it's worth mentioning that there are several other methods to conduct this calibration as well.\n",

    "For this exercise, we'll use the \"stable_lights\" band."
