    "# Working with vector and raster data (10 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most satellite data you'll work with is stored as a raster file (e.g. GeoTiff), including the nighttime lights data we've been working with. See {doc}`mod2_1_data_overview` as a refresher on file structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector files are also common with geospatial data, particularly for representing the polygons and points that represent places on earth, like specific locations (points) or entire countries (polygons).\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing remotely sensed data, you're often using both types of files so it's important to get comfortable with both. Clipping a raster image to a particular vector file boundary is a common operation, as we do in {doc}`mod3_2_image_clipping_with_VIIRS`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we'll work with raster and vector formats to calculate zonal statistics, particularly a common metric for nighttime lights called the Sum Of Lights (SOL). If you worked through the BONUS section of our last tutorial, {doc}`mod5_2_rate_of_change` you may have already done this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we'll calculate the SOL using VIIRS-DNB data from January 2015 for the country of Japan, including it's underlying prefectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our tasks in this exercise:**\n",
    "1. Brief overview of SOL and zonal statistics\n",
    "2. Import raster (nighttime lights) and vector (boundaries for Japan and prefectures) files\n",
    "3. Calculate SOL for all of Japan in 2015\n",
    "4. Calculate SOL for each \"prefecture entity\" in Japan for 2015\n",
    "\n",
    "## Brief overview of SOL and zonal statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "While visualing satellite data is interesting and can help guide inquiry, analysts must often draw some inferences from the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Zonal statistics\n",
    "A common way to do this is to summarize your raster file data, which is represented a pixel-values, by aggregating, or \"reducing\" your information to a zonal statistic, such as the mean, median, minimum value, maximum value, sum, etc. When you're working with socioeconomic or geopolitic analysis, these \"zones\" will often be administrative boundaries, such as for a country, province, or urban agglomeration, stored as vector files.\n",
    "\n",
    "These summarized data can be used for further visualization (such as with a choropleth) or for statistical analysis, including time series analysis or cross-sectional analysis. Or perhaps in regression or classification to infer some other charasterics or even predictions related to your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sum Of Lights (SOL)\n",
    "SOL is a reduction of nighttime lights data, done by summing the total radiance per pixel (DN values for DMSP-OLS data or radiance in Watts/cm2/sr for VIIRS-DNB data) for a given time period (e.g. month) for a given geospatial boundary (e.g. country).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall in {doc}`mod1_1_introduction_to_remote_sensing` that SOL is a common metric for conducting socioeconomic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Raster files\n",
    "We're looking at VIIRS-DNB data for the month of January 2015. We'll use the stray-light corrected monthly composites, the `avg_rad` band."

    "\n",
    "We will use the `reduceRegion()` function of an Image to get the sum of nighttime lights, a function you'll remember from {doc}`mod3_4_cell_statistics_band_math`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the SOL for Japan in 2015, we use the `reduceRegion` method on our Japan geometry. The resulting value is our SOL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we pass our chosen `Reducer` function, `.sum()` in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geometry\n",
    "Since our image (`viirsJan2015`) covers the entire globe, we'll constrain scope by passing a geometry. We'll use the vector files we just imported. These files have a method called `.geometry()` that extracts the vector data for the shape itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scale and raster <-> vector mapping\n",
    "We also will use the `scale` parameter set to 500 meters. This is used by `reduceRegion` to identify what data (pixels in the raster) to include in its statistic (`sum()` in our case). We wont get into the details on the affine transformations and CRS projects that factor in here (for more, read the <a href= \"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/reducers_reduce_region\">GEE documentation here</a>).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also read more there about \"weighted\" reducers, such as `ee.Reducer.mean()` or `.sum()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is helpful here, is to recall from {doc}`mod2_1_data_overview` that data in raster files are represented by cells or pixels (think grid or array). Wheras data in vector files represent formulas for calculating lines and points. \n",
    "\n",
    "So think of each pixel in the raster file as covering an area and the value (nightime radiance) represents the entire area. A weighted reducer, such as `Reducer.mean()` or `.Reducer.sum()` will calculate the portio of the pixel value based on the area of overlap (e.g. if 50% of the pixel is inside the boundary, then the value of the pixel will be scaled by 50%, etc). If a pixel is masked for data quality (like cloud coverage) or has less than 0.5% of its area inside the polygon, it will not be included.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an illustration on geometric data models in raster and vector formats, recall this image from {doc}`mod2_1_data_overview`:\n",

And others: VIIRS data are much more sensitive that DMSP-OLS, which is a good thing, but it is more susceptible to noise, particularly in low-light areas where small fluctuations are noticeable. Onboard calibration does keep the observations somewhat stable, but it's not perfect. These fluctuations are usually too small to be an issue, but if you were to sum up radiance over large areas, like that of a midsize province (to say nothing of a large one or a country), this variance adds up...literally geometrically.\n",

    "Some options are:\n",
    "1. Use another metric, like avg radiance per pixel per period, or standardize SOL by getting the SOL per period per square meter\n",

    "### Standardizing by pixel\n",

    "If we were to go back and get our SOL calculation for Japan, but instead get the per-pixel avg instead of the raw sum, you'll see that the scale is much less influential."
