    "## 1.2 Spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions in remote sensing\n",
    "\n",
    "Remotely sensed sensors are characterized by different resolutions which will impact the decision as to which data to use and for which application (this is often referred to as “Fit-for-Purpose” technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spatial resolution: \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Spatial resolution</b> signifies the size of the smallest object that can be detected as an individual entity from a given altitude and in a given point of time, i.e. the ground surface area that forms one pixel in the image. \n",

    "#### Worldview (30cm)\n",
    "![30cm](img/*.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this course:** we will be working with VIIRS-DNB data, which has a spatial resolution of about 500m per pixel at the equator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spectral resolution:\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Spectral resolution</b> signifies the sensitivity of the sensor, or the number and width of spectral bands of the sensor. The higher the spectral resolution, the narrower the wavelength range for a given channel or band. \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, multispectral imagery refers to 3 to 10 bands, while hyperspectral imagery consists of hundreds or thousands of (narrower) bands (i.e. higher spectral resolution).\n",

    "\n",
    "**In this course:** we will be working with VIIRS-DNB data, which is a single panchromatic channel covering the wavelengths ranging from 500 to 900 nanometers.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "For detailed information on the VIIRS instrument, see the <a href=\"https://ncc.nesdis.noaa.gov/documents/documentation/viirs-users-guide-tech-report-142a-v1.3.pdf\" class=\"alert-link\">VIIRS Users Guide Technical Report</a>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Temporal resolution:\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Temporal resolution</b> refers to the repeat cycle, or frequency, with which a sensor revisits the same part of the Earth’s surface. You might hear this referred to as a satellite’s “revisit time.” \n",
    "</div>\n",
    " \n",
    "Generally speaking, the larger the swath width of a satellite, which you can  think of as the width of the sensor’s field of view “cross-track” (or “left to right”) during an orbital pass , the higher the temporal resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Trade-offs in remote sensing resolution:\n",
    "There is an inherent tradeoff between spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions. Typically, the higher the spatial resolution, the lower the spectral and the temporal resolution and the higher the temporal resolution, the lower the spatial and spectral resolutions.\n",

    "**In this course:** we will be using VIIRS-DNB data, which is collected every 12 hours, once during the day and once during the night (at approximately 1:30 am local time). We’re only interested in the nighttime pass, so our data has a daily temporal resolution.  However, as we will learn, it’s helpful to aggregate data to account for noise, such as cloud-cover, so our final analysis may end up using composite data that has time periods of up to a month or a year."
