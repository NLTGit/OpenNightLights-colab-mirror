    "A <b>Jupyter notebook</b> is a web-based interactive computational environment. A Jupyter notebook is basically a JSON document that can be displayed in a browser and contains input/ output cells that can be used to enter markdown text, contain executable code, or display plots or rich media.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks have gained a lot of popularity in the scientific computing community, largely because of the ease with which users can integrate executable code with written text and plots interactively, making it a powerful tool for conducting data exploration and communicating analytical insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "Jupyter notebook comes installed with the Anaconda distribution, so if you’ve installed that already (as you should have in the last module), to open a Jupyter notebook, you can just open a terminal (and if you created a virtual environment, make sure you’ve activated it) and enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ jupyter notebook`\n",
    "\n",
    "By default the notebook uses a Python kernel (whatever Python version is in your current environment), so we dont need to worry about changing the language since we’re working in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "This launches the web server and your default browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.) will open a tab showing a file directory based on your current location {numref}`jupyter-tree`. You can navigate to existing notebook files (which contain the .ipynb extension) and open them in a new tab simply by clicking on them.\n",

It’s easy to <a href=\"https://datapastry.com/blog/why-i-dont-use-jupyter-notebooks-and-you-shouldnt-either\" class=\"alert-link\">get into bad habits</a>, especially if you’re a novice programmer. There can also be limits to managing large amounts of data using Jupyter notebooks -- a consideration with image data, such as nighttime lights, and they don’t facilitate writing modular, reusable code.\n",
