    "In the last sub-module {doc}`mod2_4_introduction_to_GEE` we discussed 2 key ways to access and analyze data in GEE: 1) through the code editor and 2) the Python API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll desribe the API\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python API\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "GEE does provide <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install\">some overview and documentation on the Python API<a/>.</div>\n",

    "### Google Colab Python API\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "Google also provides <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/earthengine-api/blob/master/python/examples/ipynb/ee-api-colab-setup.ipynb\">a guide for using the Python API in a Google Colab notebook<a/>.</div>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Relative to the JavaScript API and the code editor, documentation on the Python API is rather limited. The good news is that through use of two key Python modules, `earthengine-api` and `geemap` you can get much of the funcationality as in the code editor even if you have to use the JavaScript documentation as a primary reference as to how many of the data structures and algorithms work.\n",

    "\n",
    "The key functionality of `geemap` is organized into several modules {cite}`wu2020geemap`: \n",
    "- `geemap`: the main module for interactive mapping with Google Earth Engine, ipyleaflet, and ipywidgets.\n",
    "- `eefolium`: a module for interactive mapping with Earth Engine and folium. It is designed for users to run geemap with Google Colab. (Note: Google colab doesnt currently integrate with ipyleaflet)\n",
    "- `conversion`: utilities for automatically converting Earth Engine JavaScripts to Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "- `basemaps`: a module for adding various XYZ and WMS tiled basemaps.\n",
    "- `legends`: a module for adding customized legends to interactive maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting started\n",
    "`geemap` is not included in the standard Python library, which means you must download and install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using a virtual environment (as per {doc}`mod2_2_getting_started_with_Python`, activate it and from command line interface (CLI), enter:\n",
