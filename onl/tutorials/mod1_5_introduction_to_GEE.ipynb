    "## Google Earth Engine (GEE) Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "<a href=\"https://earthengine.google.com/\" class=\"alert-link\">Google Earth Engine (GEE)</a> is a cloud-based platform for planetary-scale geospatial analysis which allows to process a variety of geographical data at scale and handle large geographical datasets. \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since geographical data are often large and complicated to store, GEE provides a quickly accessible collection of ready-to-use data products. In addition, it is open and free to the public (for non-commercial use).\n",
    "\n",
    "GEE consists of a multi-petabyte “ready-to-use” data catalog alongside a high-performance, intrinsically parallel computation service. It can be accessed and controlled through an Internet-accessible application programming interface (API) and an associated web-based interactive development environment (IDE) that enables rapid prototyping and visualization of results {cite}`gorelick2017google`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because all the datasets are available on the GEE platform, there is no need to manage the data, download them, change the file format, or update the geographic projection. It uses the power of thousands of computers located in Google data centers to carry out its heavy processing. This distributed network allows the user to finish a task in a few minutes for small areas and few days for a world-scale study. \n",
    "\n",
    "GEE provides access to numerous remotely sensed datasets and derived products, including DMSP-OLS and VIIRS DNB. Some of the data is already provided  in the platform processed and “ready-to-use”. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "The GEE platform provides <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/\" class=\"alert-link\">comprehensive documentation</a> and tutorials with videos as well as an  Application Programming Interface (API) dictionary to help users to learn how to write and use every JavaScript function in GEE. \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/google-earth-engine-developers?pli=1\" class=\"alert-link\">The GEE developer forum</a> is a very helpful resource for beginners. On this forum it is possible to directly ask a question to the GEE community including GEE programmers and founders. \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## GEE Access\n",
    "Accessing GEE is easy. Aspiring users will first need to <a href=\"https://signup.earthengine.google.com/\" class=\"alert-link\">sign up to the platform</a> with their Google account. It is the same account, people use to access Youtube, Google drive, Gmail and any Google service. Google usually gives access to new users within 24 hours. Then, all a user needs to access GEE from anywhere in the world is an internet connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data in GEE can be analyzed in two ways:  \n",
    "- 1) through the Javascript API via the GEE code editor, or \n",
    "- 2) a Python API, geemap, that can be accessed through any Python environment, such as Jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In this course:** we will run these processes through Jupyter notebooks Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to geemap\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "<a href=\"https://geemap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html\" class=\"alert-link\">geemap</a> is a Python package for interactive mapping with GEE.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted, GEE provides both JavaScript and Python APIs for making computational requests to the Earth Engine servers; however, the documentation and functionality of the Python API is rather limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "geemap was designed to fill this gap and enables users to analyze and visualize Earth Engine datasets interactively -- including within a Jupyter environment. Additionally, the automated JavaScript-to-Python conversion module of the geemap package reduces the time needed to convert existing GEE JavaScripts to Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key functionality of geemap is organized into several modules {cite}`wu2020geemap`: \n",
    "- `geemap`: the main module for interactive mapping with Google Earth Engine, ipyleaflet, and ipywidgets.\n",
    "- `eefolium`: a module for interactive mapping with Earth Engine and folium. It is designed for users to run geemap with Google Colab. (Note: Google colab doesnt currently integrate with ipyleaflet)\n",
    "- `conversion`: utilities for automatically converting Earth Engine JavaScripts to Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "- `basemaps`: a module for adding various XYZ and WMS tiled basemaps.\n",
    "- `legends`: a module for adding customized legends to interactive maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting started\n",
    "geemap is not included in the standard Python library, which means you must download and install it. If you set up a conda environment following our recomendation in {doc}`mod1_3_getting_started_with_Python` you can skip this step, because `geemap` is already installed!\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise you must install it. If you're using `conda`, make sure your conda environment is activate and from command line interface (CLI), enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda install -c conda-forge geemap`\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if you're not using `conda` you can also install `geemap` with `pip`, from CLI enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install geemap`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that because this installation asks you if you want to proceed (you do), you'll want to set the `-y` flag, which will automatically answer yes to that prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "You only need to install geemap once, but you’ll have to import it into any Python script or Jupyter notebook that uses it, which is as simple as typing this line of code in your Jupyter notebook:"
