    "In the context of remote sensing, the process of <b>making a composite</b> generally refers to taking a collection of spatially overlapping images and applying an aggregate function, also known as a \"reducer\" function, to these images to create a single composite image. For example, you may want to create an annual composite for a series of images by applying a reducer function, such as calculating the median, to the images to get a single image for the year that contains the median values per pixel.\n",
